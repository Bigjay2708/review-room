# Review Room Application

This is a Next.js application with TypeScript for a movie review platform called "Review Room". The application allows users to:

1. Browse movies
2. Read and write movie reviews
3. Rate movies
4. Watch movie trailers

The app uses:

- TMDB API for movie data - API key = 7724b652797ebd84ce8b198112443834
- MongoDB for storing user reviews and ratings - MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://bigjay2708:agoodsecret@the-review-room-cluster.jn0xlcl.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=the-review-room-cluster
- Next.js App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety

When suggesting code, ensure it aligns with the bright and stylish UI theme of the application.
